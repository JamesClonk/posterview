# posterview
Display posters on a wall-mounted Android tablet

This is just a super simple, quick and dirty, very hacky Android app. Its purpose being to show a bunch of posters (found in a folder on the filesystem) in random intervals in fullscreen without any other UI element disturbing it, and keeping the screen awake and unlocked. Clicking on a poster also plays a sound/music file if found in the same folder.
